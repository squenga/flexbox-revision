				<div class="infoContainer">
					<div class="infoBox">
						<p>The CHamoru people have inhabited the Mariana Islands for more than 4,000 years. Our ancestors referred to themselves as “taotao tåno,” or “the people of the land.” They saw the land not as a commodity, but as a connection to life beyond us with which to protect and respect. The land, in conjunction with the sea, gives life to the CHamoru people.</p>

				<h3 class="subTitle">WESTERN INVASION</h3>

				<div class="infoContainer">
					<div class="infoBox">
						<p>In 1521, the Spaniards sought to conquer the island for economic gain and exploitation. Unlike the ancient CHamorus who saw life in the land, they saw the land as physical possession to eventually conquer for short-term purposes. These Western views were also shared by the U.S., who in 1898, colonized the island after Japanese occupation. The U.S. saw Guam as a strategic military location with which they could establish a Westernmost area to harbor nuclear weapons, bombers, and military bases. Yet, the U.S. took more from the CHamorus than just their land. In the process, they removed our culture, values, and ways of life.</p>

				<h3 class="subTitle">NOW</h3>

				<div class="infoContainer">
					<div class="infoBox">
						<p class="infoBox">The U.S. military occupies nearly 30 percent of the island. Over the years, military buildup has desecrated multiple ancestral burial sites. In their presence, the U.S. has supplanted two military bases: Anderson Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam. Now, the military buildup is looking to add a third base: Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz. Not only does this plan serve as a threat to significant ancestral land, it also directly threatens Guam residents. The base’s proposed location along Guam’s northern coast sits significantly near the Northern Lens Aquifer, the sole source of the island’s drinking water. This new base is proposed to include a firing range, endangering the land and groundwater of the island. Our environment, health, and resources are all at risk of contamination due to the military buildup. It is crucial, now, for our land to be returned for our survival.</p>
